The security policies derived from the business policy.
So the business policy describes: what we're going to do.
Not how we're going to do it.
This security policy describes how we're going to do it.
Security enforcement point/security mechanisms  - technical implementation of that security policy.
(Security policy implementation mechanism or delivery vehicle)

Some examples of those are protocol suppression for example to turn off FTP.
That security policy would 

be no FTPs allow, 
Business policy (No large-scale data movements)
Security policy would be no FTPs allow
Security enforcement point would be to disable FTP,


Security policies -> (have technical implementation ) Security services ->
-> ( s. p. controls/implemented by hard/software/processes ) security mechanisms (uses sec. services to enforce sec. policy)

Security policy: 

Security services: Enchanse security of data procesing systems using one or more security mechanisms.
Authentication, 
Access control, Data confidentiality,
Data integrity, Non-repudiation, availability


Security mechanisms:
biometrics, certificates, passwords and keys, user permisions, vpns, malware detection, 
secure channels, time limits, allarms, locks, backups, dmz, firewalls, proxies, single acces point, vp


Specific security mechanisms:
Cryptography, digital signatures, access controls,
Tdata integrity, authentication exchange, traffic padding,
routing control, notarization

Pervasice security mechanisms:
trusted functionality, security labes,event detection,
security audit trails, security recovery


Security services and mechanisms are closely related because a mechanism
or combination of mechanisms are used to provide a service:
Security services:
    Authentication: assures recipient that the message is from the source that it claims to be from. 
    Access Control: controls who can have access to resource under what condition
    Availability: available to authorized entities for 24/7. 
    Confidentiality: information is not made available to unauthorized individual
    Integrity: assurance that the message is unaltered
    Non-Repudiation: protection against denial of sending or receiving in the communication
	
	
	
ITIL (information technology Infrastructure library)
ITIL is best practice framework describing how IT resources should be organized to deliver Business value.
It models how to document processes, functions, and roles of IT Service Management (ITSM)


Service Lifecycle phases:
Service strategy - plant on how I will support my customers: Service portfolio financial, demand, business relationship management. 
Service Design - designing new or editing existing services: service catalogue management, service level (SLA), Information security management, supplier management, Availability Management
Service Transition - build or deploy changes: change management, project management, release and deployment management, service validation and testing, knowledge management
Service Operations - steady state monitoring:event management, incident management, problem management
Service continual improvements - continual service improvement: review metrics, identify opportunities, test and prioritize, implement improvements


Key ITL service management Processes:
Problem - (lifecycle of managing problems) cause of one or more incidents, root cause
Change - manage changes (recognize, plan, assess impact, get approoval, shceduling, implement, closure) to baseline service assets and configuration items across the ITL Lifecycle
Incident - (unplanned interruption to IT service) return state of service as fast as possible
Log->Assign->Track->Categorize->Prioritize->Resolve->Close
Event - detected occurence that has some significance to IT infra or delivery.
Service level (SLA) = planing, coordinating, monitoring and reporting SLA. Review of achievements and meeting the requirements. Service's gradual improvement.
Information Security Management - having and maintaining Information Security Policy and specific security policies that address each aspect of strategy, objectives and regulations.


As you have heard in this module, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are not organization-specific nor technology-specific.
You can learn more about the ITIL processes on Wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL#ITIL_4_Edition .
You also can view the certification's that only individuals can achieve ion the Axelos' website:  https://www.axelos.com/welcome-to-itil-4

What is IT Service Management?
Depending on your organization or the organization you may find a future opportunity to explore, many times there is confusion between IT Service Management and ITIL.  
Read through Axelos' explanation of how IT Service Management (ITSM) and ITIL are related.
https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/itil/what-is-it-service-management
 “The implementation and management of quality IT 
 services that meet the needs of the business. 
 IT service management is performed by IT service providers
 through an appropriate mix of people, process and information technology.”

CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability - key security objectives.
Confidentiality - preserving authorized restrictions information access control and preventing information disclosure. 
Loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of guarded information. 
Integrity - guarding against improper information modification or destruction. Including information 
non-repudiation and authenticity. Loss is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.
Availability - timely and reliable access to information. Loss of availability is the distruption of acces to an information system.


Authenticity - genuine and verifiable.
Accountability - mapping actions to an identity.
